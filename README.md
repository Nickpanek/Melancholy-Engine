## 🎹 About The Project
The **Melancholy Engine** is a procedural audio generation system designed to emulate contemporary minimalist piano composition. Unlike stochastic generators, this engine utilizes a **Constraint-Based Harmonic Model** to execute specific emotional performance directions defined by the author.

This repository serves as the **immutable timestamp and proof of ownership** for the source code and the resulting asset library.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture
The engine functions as a "Virtual Pianist" executing a Directed Aleatoric score:

* **Harmonic Constraint:** Strictly enforces Natural Minor and Dorian modes to evoke specific emotional responses.
* **Rubato Simulation:** The time-delta function utilizes a sine-wave drift algorithm to simulate human tempo fluctuations (breathing/hesitation).
* **Velocity Layering:** Differentiates "Left Hand" (Accompaniment) and "Right Hand" (Melody) dynamics to simulate a realistic performance.

## 📦 The Asset Library
This repository contains the **"Panek Piano Collection"**, a verified library of unique musical compositions generated by this engine.

* **Manifest:** `Panek_Piano_Manifest.csv` (Internal to the zip archive).
* **Archive:** `NickPanek_Piano_Collection.zip` (The complete collection of MIDI assets).
